## Live Spider Crab Mission (for Lolo)

### The Challenge

Japanese spider crab (タカアシガニ / takaashigani) is a deep-sea species primarily caught in **Shizuoka Prefecture** (Suruga Bay area), not commonly sold live in Tokyo markets.

### Potential Sources in Tokyo

1. **Toyosu Market** (豊洲市場)
   - Contact vendors in advance to special order
   - [Tsukiji Sabuchan](https://tsukiji.siile.jp/en/) - English-friendly service that can source from market
   - [Hitoku Shoten](https://www.hitokushoten.com/inbound.html) - Can try to get items not in stock

2. **Direct inquiry needed:**
   - Call/email vendors asking specifically for 活タカアシガニ (live spider crab)
   - May need to be sourced from Shizuoka and transported to Tokyo

3. **Alternative: Substitute crab species more readily available live:**
   - 毛ガニ (Kegani) - Horsehair crab from Hokkaido
   - タラバガニ (Taraba-gani) - King crab
   - ズワイガニ (Zuwaigani) - Snow crab

### Transport Requirements

**Timeline:** Purchase Thursday 6-7 PM → Midnight flight → ~13 hours to Manila

**Packaging checklist:**
- [ ] Sturdy styrofoam cooler with ventilation holes
- [ ] Seawater-soaked newspaper or seaweed (keeps gills moist)
- [ ] Gel ice packs (maintain 2-4°C / 35-40°F)
- [ ] "LIVE SEAFOOD" and "THIS SIDE UP" labels
- [ ] Leak-proof inner lining

**Key survival factors:**
- Keep crab belly-down, back-up (never upside down)
- Humidity is critical - gills must stay moist
- Cool temperature slows metabolism
- Adequate airflow (punch holes if sealing box)
- 48 hours survival is achievable with proper packing

**Airline considerations:**
- Check with your airline for live seafood policies
- Usually allowed as checked baggage in approved containers
- Some airlines require leak-proof containers (no bare styrofoam)

**After arrival:**
- Transfer to seawater tank immediately
- Crabs excrete waste through gills when returned to water
