## Laundry Math

**23 days with 1-2 washes = ~8-12 day cycles**

| Item | Have | Need per cycle | Verdict |
|------|------|----------------|---------|
| Socks | 7 | 7-8 | OK - barely. Do laundry every 7 days |
| Underwear | 7 | 7-8 | OK - same as above |
| Base layers | 4 | 2-3 (rotate) | GOOD - base layers can go 2-3 days |
| Pants | 3 | 2-3 | OK - pants can stretch longer |

**Verdict:** You're cutting it close. Plan to do laundry **every 7 days** (once in Nagano, once in Yuzawa). Both accommodations should have laundry.

## Missing Items - CRITICAL

### Snowboarding
- [ ] **GOGGLES** - You didn't mention these. Essential.
- [ ] **Ski/snowboard socks** - Regular socks won't cut it. Need 2-3 pairs of thick, moisture-wicking ski socks
- [ ] **Snowboard jacket** - You have puffers but no actual snow jacket? Your Columbia might work if waterproof
- [ ] **Neck gaiter/buff** - Balaclava is good but a lighter option for milder days
- [ ] **Hand warmers / toe warmers** - Cheap, buy in Japan at any konbini
- [ ] **Sunscreen SPF 50** - Snow reflection is brutal
- [ ] **Lip balm with SPF** - Your lips will wreck otherwise

### Tech
- [ ] **Power bank** - You have the cord but didn't list the actual power bank
- [ ] **Phone charger** - Didn't mention
- [ ] **Extra SD card** - For Insta360

### Travel
- [ ] **Passport**
- [ ] **Japan Rail Pass or Suica/ICOCA** - For trains
- [ ] **Cash (Yen)** - Many ski town spots are cash only

## Tokyo Night Out Fit

You want: chill, coordinated, white shirt vibe

**Problem:** You only listed short sleeve tees and it's January in Tokyo (5-10°C / 40-50°F at night). You need a **long sleeve option** for going out.

**Suggested fit:**
- Black Uniqlo stretchy pants (cleaner than jeans)
- White long sleeve (you need to add this or pack one)
- Varsity jacket (good vibe) OR light Columbia puffer unzipped
- Beige Adidas
- Cap optional

**What to add:**
- [ ] **1-2 white/neutral long sleeve shirts** - For going out
- [ ] **1 button-up or Oxford shirt** - Optional but elevates the fit

1. Goggles
2. 2-3 ski socks
3. Long sleeve shirts for Tokyo
4. Power bank (if not packed)
5. Sunscreen + lip balm

2. Hand/toe warmers
3. Extra SD card

### Can Buy in Japan
